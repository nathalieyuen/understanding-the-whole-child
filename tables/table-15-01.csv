"**Identity-Diffusion** status is a status that characterizes those who have neither explored the options, nor made a commitment to an identity.",The individual does not have firm commitments regarding the issues in question and is not making progress toward them. Those who persist in this identity may drift aimlessly with little connection to those around them or have little sense of purpose in life.
**Identity-Foreclosure** status is the status for those who have made a commitment to an identity without having explored the options.,"The individual has not engaged in any identity experimentation and has established an identity based on the choices or values of others. Some parents may make these decisions for their children and do not grant the teen the opportunity to make choices. In other instances, teens may strongly identify with parents and others in their life and wish to follow in their footsteps."
**Identity-Moratorium** status is a status that describes those who are exploring in an attempt to establish an identity but have yet to have made any commitment.,"The individual is exploring various choices but has not yet made a clear commitment to any of them. This can be an anxious and emotionally tense time period as the adolescent experiments with different roles and explores various beliefs. Nothing is certain and there are many questions, but few answers."
"**Identity-Achievement** status refers to the status for those who, after exploration, have made a commitment.",The individual has attained a coherent and committed identity based on personal decisions. This is a long process and is not often achieved by the end of adolescence
