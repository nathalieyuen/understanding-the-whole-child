Name of Stage,Descriptions of Stage
Oral Stage,The oral stage lasts from birth until around age 2. The infant is all id. At this stage  all stimulation and comfort is focused on the mouth and is based on the reflex of sucking. Too much indulgence or too little stimulation may lead to fixation.
Anal Stage,The anal stage coincides with potty training or learning to manage biological urges. The ego is beginning to develop in this stage.  Anal fixation may result in a person who is compulsively clean and organized or one who is sloppy and lacks self-control.
Phallic Stage,The phallic stage occurs in early childhood and marks the development of the superego and a sense of masculinity or femininity as culture dictates.
Latency,Latency occurs during middle childhood when a child's urges quiet down and friendships become the focus. The ego and superego can be refined as the child learns how to cooperate and negotiate with others.
Genital Stage,The genital stage begins with puberty and continues through adulthood. Now the preoccupation is that of sex and reproduction.
