Unoccupied Play,Children’s behavior seems more random and without a specific goal. This is the least common form of play.
Solitary Play,"Children play by themselves, do not interact with others, nor are they engaging in similar activities as the children around them."
Onlooker Play,"Children are observing other children playing. They may comment on the activities and even make suggestions, but will not directly join the play."
Parallel Play,"Children play alongside each other, using similar toys, but do not directly act with each other"
Associative Play,"Children will interact with each other and share toys, but are not working toward a common goal."
Cooperative Play,Children are interacting to achieve a common goal. Children may take on different tasks to reach that goal.
