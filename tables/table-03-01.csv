Method,Description
The Lamaze Method,"The emphasis of this method is on teaching the woman to be in control in the process of delivery. It includes learning muscle relaxation, breathing through contractions, having a focal point (usually a picture to look at) during contractions and having a support person who goes through the training process with the mother and serves as a coach during delivery."
The Leboyer Method,"This method involves giving birth in a quiet, dimly lit room and allowing the newborn to lie on the mother’s stomach with the umbilical cord intact for several minutes while being given a warm bath."
Dick-Read Method / Mongan Method / Hypnobirthing,This method comes from the suggestion that the fear of childbirth increases tension and makes the process of childbearing more painful. It emphasizes the use of relaxation and proper breathing with contractions as well as family support and education.
Bradley Method,“The Bradley Method focuses on preparing the mother for a natural childbirth coached by her partner. They learn techniques to reduce the perception of pain and stay relaxed. The emphasis is on being prepared for an unassisted vaginal birth without medication.^[Oberg, Erica (n.d.). Childbirth Delivery Methods and Types.

Alexander Technique,"This is a technique that can be used during childbirth that involves training to stop habitual reactions to pain, such as tensing muscles and increase conscious awareness and control over posture and movement. This involves being able to move freely and stay upright during labor and using body positioning that is beneficial to the labor process.^[Machover, Ilana. (n.d.).

Waterbirth,"Involves immersion in warm water. Proponents believe this method is safe and provides many benefits for both mother and infant, including pain relief and a less traumatic birth experience for the baby. However, critics argue that the procedure introduces unnecessary risks to the infant such as infection and water inhalation.^[[Water Birth](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Water_birth) by Wikidoc is licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)]"
Lotus Birth,"Or umbilical cord nonseverance – UCNS, is the practice of leaving the umbilical cord uncut after childbirth so that the baby is left attached to the placenta until the cord naturally separates at the umbilicus. This usually occurs within 3–10 days after birth. The practice is performed mainly for spiritual purposes of the parents, including for the perceived spiritual connection between placenta and newborn.^[[Lotus Birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_birth) by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)]"
Silent Birth,"Sometimes known as quiet birth, is a birthing procedure advised by L. Ron Hubbard and advocated by Scientologists in which "everyone attending the birth should refrain from spoken words as much as possible."^[[Silent Birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_birth) by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)]"
